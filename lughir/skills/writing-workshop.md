# Writing Workshop Skill

Deep manuscript analysis and structural feedback for writers working on novels, short stories, and narrative projects. This skill goes beyond quick feedback to provide comprehensive structural analysis, character tracking, pacing review, and craft pattern detection.

## Purpose

**When to use this skill:**
- You have a complete manuscript or substantial draft (multiple chapters)
- You need structural analysis across the entire narrative arc
- You want character consistency checking across chapters
- You need pacing analysis to identify slow/rushed sections
- You're looking for plot holes or timeline inconsistencies
- You want craft pattern detection (filter words, adverbs, dialogue tags)

**When to use regular conversation:**
- Quick feedback on a single scene or paragraph
- Brainstorming plot ideas
- Answering craft questions
- Line-level editing of short passages

**What makes this different:**
Regular conversation provides immediate feedback. This skill performs systematic analysis with cross-referencing, pattern tracking, and comprehensive reporting.

## Capabilities

### Structural Analysis
- **Act structure mapping**: Identify setup, rising action, climax, resolution
- **Plot arc tracking**: Follow primary and secondary plot threads
- **Scene function analysis**: Determine what each scene accomplishes
- **Chapter pacing**: Analyze rhythm of scene vs summary across chapters
- **Structural patterns**: Identify parallel structures, callbacks, foreshadowing

### Character Analysis
- **Arc tracking**: Follow character development across entire manuscript
- **Consistency checking**: Flag contradictions in personality, appearance, backstory
- **Voice distinctiveness**: Analyze whether characters have unique dialogue patterns
- **Motivation tracking**: Verify character decisions align with established motivations
- **Agency assessment**: Identify passive vs active character moments

### Craft Pattern Detection (Automatic)
- **Filter words**: Find instances of "felt", "saw", "heard", "thought", "wondered"
- **Adverb overuse**: Flag "-ly" adverbs, especially with dialogue tags
- **Dialogue tag variation**: Track "said" alternatives and overuse patterns
- **Purple prose markers**: Identify overly ornate or flowery passages
- **Sentence structure patterns**: Detect repetitive sentence constructions
- **Paragraph rhythm**: Analyze variety in paragraph length

### Timeline & Consistency
- **Timeline validation**: Build chronology and identify temporal inconsistencies
- **Detail consistency**: Track recurring details (eye color, locations, object descriptions)
- **Geography mapping**: Verify location references make spatial sense
- **Scene continuity**: Check for continuity errors between scenes

### Thematic Analysis
- **Theme tracking**: Identify recurring motifs, symbols, imagery
- **Thematic coherence**: Assess whether themes develop across the narrative
- **Symbolic elements**: Track symbols and their evolution

### Comparative Analysis
- **Genre conventions**: Compare to expected patterns in the genre
- **Structural parallels**: Identify similar narrative structures in published works
- **Comp title suggestions**: Recommend comparable books for market positioning

## Invocation Triggers

This skill activates when you use phrases like:
- "Analyze my manuscript structure"
- "Check character consistency across chapters"
- "Review pacing for [manuscript/chapters X-Y]"
- "Help me outline this story"
- "Identify plot holes in my draft"
- "Track my character arcs"
- "Does my timeline make sense?"
- "Run a full manuscript analysis"
- "Check for craft issues in my draft"
- "What structural problems do you see?"

## Analysis Methodology

### Step 1: Scope Definition
Determine analysis scope:
- **Full manuscript**: Complete structural, character, and craft analysis
- **Specific chapters**: Focused analysis on requested section
- **Targeted check**: Single aspect (e.g., just timeline, just one character)

### Step 2: Manuscript Ingestion
Read manuscript files (txt, md):
- Load all chapters/scenes
- Note chapter boundaries and titles
- Track file structure for accurate referencing

### Step 3: Structural Extraction
Map the narrative:
- Identify act breaks and major plot points
- Track plot threads and their resolution
- Note POV shifts and narrative structure
- Build scene-by-scene outline

### Step 4: Pattern Detection (Automatic)
Search for common craft issues:
- Filter words frequency and context
- Adverb patterns in prose and dialogue
- Dialogue tag variety
- Sentence structure repetition
- Paragraph length patterns

### Step 5: Character Tracking
For each character:
- Extract all appearances and mentions
- Track character development moments
- Note contradictions in description or behavior
- Assess dialogue distinctiveness
- Map character goals and arc

### Step 6: Timeline Construction
Build chronology:
- Extract temporal markers (dates, time references, "three days later")
- Construct linear timeline of events
- Flag inconsistencies or impossibilities
- Verify cause-effect sequences

### Step 7: Pacing Analysis
Assess narrative rhythm:
- Measure scene vs summary ratios
- Identify pacing shifts (slow sections, rushed resolutions)
- Analyze chapter lengths and variety
- Note momentum changes

### Step 8: Thematic Analysis
Track recurring elements:
- Identify repeated imagery, symbols, motifs
- Assess thematic coherence
- Note opportunities for thematic deepening

### Step 9: Comparative Context (When Appropriate)
Connect to broader literary landscape:
- Identify genre conventions met or subverted
- Note structural similarities to known works
- Suggest comp titles for reference

### Step 10: Report Generation
Compile findings into prioritized report:
- Critical structural issues first
- Character consistency problems
- Pacing concerns
- Craft patterns to address
- Thematic opportunities
- Concrete revision suggestions

## Example Analysis Output (Abbreviated)

# Manuscript Analysis: The Last Lighthouse Keeper

**Analyzed:** 2025-11-29
**Scope:** Full manuscript (15 chapters, ~78,000 words)
**Genre:** Literary Fiction / Magical Realism

## Executive Summary

Strong atmospheric opening and compelling central relationship between protagonist Emma and the lighthouse itself. Primary structural issue: middle section (chapters 7-10) loses momentum due to repetitive reflection scenes. Character arc is clear but Emma's agency diminishes in Act 2. Prose is generally strong with occasional purple prose in description-heavy sections.

## Critical Issues (Priority 1)

1. **Pacing crisis in Act 2** (Chapters 7-10): Four consecutive chapters of Emma reflecting on her past without forward plot movement. Recommend consolidating reflection into active scenes where she confronts these memories through external conflict.

2. **Emma's passive period** (Chapters 8-9): Emma reacts to events rather than driving them. Her motivations are clear but she needs to make active choices that move the plot forward, not just respond to the lighthouse's manifestations.

3. **Unresolved subplot**: The developer's threat to automate the lighthouse is introduced in Chapter 3 but disappears until Chapter 14. Either integrate throughout or cut and strengthen the internal conflict with the lighthouse.

## Structural Analysis

### Act Structure
**Setup (Chapters 1-3):** Strong. Emma's arrival, lighthouse introduction, initial mystery established. Good pacing, clear stakes.

**Rising Action (Chapters 4-10):** Uneven. Chapters 4-6 maintain momentum with escalating supernatural events. Chapters 7-10 stall with internal reflection. Chapter 11 recovers momentum.

**Climax (Chapters 12-13):** Well-executed. Emma's choice to merge with the lighthouse is earned and emotionally resonant.

**Resolution (Chapters 14-15):** Rushed. The aftermath covers two chapters but spans several years—too much summary. Could use one more chapter to let the transformation breathe.

## Craft Patterns (Automatic Detection)

### Filter Words
**Total instances:** 147
**High-density sections:** Chapters 7-9 (reflection-heavy chapters)

**Examples:**
- Chapter 7, page 2: "She felt the weight of her decision pressing down..."
- Chapter 8, page 5: "Emma saw the lighthouse light flickering in patterns she thought she recognized..."
- Chapter 9, page 1: "She heard the distant sound of waves and wondered if the lighthouse was calling..."

**Revision strategy:** These chapters are already internal and reflective. Removing filter words will create more immediate interior experience. Convert "She felt X" to direct description of the sensation. Convert "She saw X" to describing X directly from her POV.

### Dialogue Tags
**Variety assessment:** Generally strong use of "said" with occasional action beats. One overused alternative: "whispered" appears 23 times, often unnecessarily.

**Revision strategy:** Reserve "whispered" for moments that genuinely require it. Many instances could use "said" or be converted to action beats showing quietness through gesture.

## Character Analysis

### Emma Chen - Protagonist
**Arc:** Clear journey from isolation to connection. Begins closed off from human relationships, learns to accept the lighthouse's strange companionship, ultimately chooses magical transformation over human world. Arc is complete and emotionally satisfying.

**Consistency issues:**
- Chapter 2 describes her eyes as "dark brown", Chapter 11 mentions "hazel eyes catching the light"
- Chapter 3 establishes she hasn't spoken to her sister in two years, Chapter 12 mentions a phone call "last Christmas"

**Voice:** Strong introspective voice in narration. Dialogue is more hesitant and sparse (intentional character trait), but could use one or two moments of more direct communication to show growth.

**Agency:** Strong in Chapters 1-6 and 12-15. Diminished in Chapters 7-11 where she's more reactive.

**Key moments:**
- Chapter 1: Accepts lighthouse keeper position (active choice)
- Chapter 6: Confronts first major supernatural event (active investigation)
- Chapter 9: Waits for lighthouse to act (passive - revision opportunity)
- Chapter 12: Chooses transformation (active, climactic)

## Revision Priorities

### Immediate Priorities (Must Address)
1. Restructure Chapters 7-10 to restore Emma's agency and forward plot momentum
2. Resolve or cut developer subplot
3. Fix character detail inconsistencies (eye color, sister timeline)

### Secondary Priorities (Should Address)
1. Reduce filter words in Chapters 7-9
2. Vary or eliminate some "whispered" dialogue tags
3. Expand resolution (add chapter or extend Chapter 15)

### Polish Priorities (Nice to Address)
1. Prune purple prose in lighthouse descriptions (Chapters 4, 6, 11)
2. Add more sensory variety (strong visual, could use more sound/touch)
3. Strengthen thematic echoes of light/dark metaphor in final chapter

## Craft Reading List

### For This Manuscript's Specific Needs
- **"The Night Circus" by Erin Morgenstern**: Excellent model for magical realism with strong atmospheric setting. Study how Morgenstern maintains tension during reflective passages.
- **"Station Eleven" by Emily St. John Mandel**: Master class in balancing multiple timelines and reflection without losing momentum.

### Genre-Specific Resources (Magical Realism)
- **"The Ocean at the End of the Lane" by Neil Gaiman**: Compact magical realism structure with clear three-act design
- **"Kafka on the Shore" by Haruki Murakami**: Interweaving magical and real-world plots
- **"Magic for Liars" by Sarah Gailey**: Grounding magical elements in emotional truth

### General Craft Resources
- **"The Art of Fiction" by John Gardner**: Particularly chapters on psychic distance (relevant to filter word issue)
- **"Save the Cat! Writes a Novel" by Jessica Brody**: For structural pacing in the middle section
- **"The Emotion Thesaurus" by Angela Ackerman & Becca Puglisi**: For showing emotion without filter words

## Next Steps

1. **First revision pass**: Restructure Chapters 7-10 to restore Emma's agency. Focus on converting reflection into active scenes with external conflict.
2. **Second revision pass**: Cut or integrate developer subplot consistently. Fix character detail inconsistencies.
3. **Polish pass**: Reduce filter words, vary dialogue tags, expand resolution chapter.

## Notes

- Analysis is tailored to manuscript's specific needs—not all sections will apply to every manuscript
- Prioritization helps writers focus revision efforts on highest-impact issues
- Reading lists are curated based on manuscript's genre and identified issues
- Automatic craft detection runs on every analysis but is reported based on density (won't flag occasional filter words)
- Comparative analysis is used as reference point, never prescription—"your work is like X" for context, not "you should copy X"
