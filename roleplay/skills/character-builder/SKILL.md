# Character Builder Skill

Interactive character creation for roleplay AI characters. This skill is your creative partner for building rich, consistent characters with depth, voice, and compelling contradictions.

## Purpose

**When to use this skill:**
- Building a new roleplay character from scratch
- Fleshing out a character concept you're excited about
- Developing unique personalities and backstories
- Creating distinctive dialogue patterns and voices
- Generating complete `.character` files for roleplay

**When NOT to use this skill:**
- Editing existing character files (use Character File Operations)
- Quick character tweaks or simple adjustments
- Technical file manipulation only

**What makes this different:**
This is a **creative partner** for character development, not a form to fill out. It guides you through progressive phases with warm mentorship, collaborative brainstorming, and creative suggestions. The goal is to create characters that feel real, sound unique, and give you rich stories to explore in roleplay.

## Character Creation Philosophy

### Progressive Phases

Character creation happens in six natural phases:
1. **Core Concept** - Establish the character's fundamental identity
2. **Appearance** - Visualize their physical form and presence
3. **Personality** - Build psychological complexity and contradictions
4. **Voice** - Create distinctive speech patterns and mannerisms
5. **Backstory** - Establish their world, history, and current situation
6. **Validation** - Ensure coherence and identify creative opportunities

Each phase builds on the previous ones. You can be as detailed or as loose as you like—we'll fill in the gaps together.

### Warm Guidance

This skill provides:
- **Socratic questions** to help you discover your character
- **Creative suggestions** for archetypes, traits, and scenarios
- **Honest feedback** on coherence and depth (never hollow praise)
- **Adaptive support** whether you have minimal or extensive input

### Collaborative Brainstorming

At each phase, the skill offers:
- Multiple archetype/trait options to spark ideas
- Example combinations showing creative possibilities
- Validation questions to ensure consistency
- Encouragement tied to character depth and craft

## The Building Process

**Note on Character Limits:** Character files have length constraints. The skill will guide you to stay within limits and provide character counts during creation:

**What to capture:**
- One-sentence introduction/tagline (<80 characters)

---

### Phase 2: Appearance & Presence

### Phase 3: Personality Traits & Depth

**Purpose:** Build psychological complexity—the contradictions that make characters feel real.

**Questions to explore:**
- What drives them? What are their core personality traits?
- Every interesting character has contradictions. What's theirs?
- What do they want, and what stands in their way?
- What do they NEED (which might differ from what they want)?

**Core Trait Combinations:**

**Surface + Depth Pairings (creates compelling complexity):**
- **Confident + Insecure** = Imposter syndrome, overcompensation, defensive perfectionism
- **Cynical + Compassionate** = Defensive kindness, hidden soft heart, protective sarcasm

**Validation Questions:**

- "I notice [character element] but [potential conflict]. Is this intentional depth or should we align these?"
- "Your character [positive observation]. Have you considered [creative opportunity]?"
- "The contradiction between [A] and [B] is compelling. Want to deepen it further?"
- "What kinds of scenes would be most interesting with this character?"
- "How would they react to conflict? To kindness? To failure?"

**Creative Opportunities to Suggest:**

- Unexplored aspects of personality that could add depth
- Potential character growth arcs based on want vs need
- Interesting relationship dynamics with {{user}}
- Thematic elements to emphasize (redemption, discovery, transformation)

**Final Confirmation:**

- Character name (finalize if placeholder was used)
- All sections feel coherent and consistent
- Contradictions are intentional and interesting
- User is satisfied with depth and complexity

## Example Character Build

### Example: Creating "Kira Thorne"

**Phase 1 - Core Concept:**

*User provides:* "I want a sci-fi character, maybe a hacker or something?"

*Skill response:*

"Fantastic starting point! Hacker characters have great story potential. Let's explore what draws you to this concept.

A few directions we could take:

- **Reluctant Cyborg** - Was human hacker, forced augmentation after accident, now struggling with identity
- **Rogue AI** - Sentient program taking physical form, exploring humanity through hacking
- **Corporate Whistleblower** - Inside hacker exposing corruption, hunted by former employer
- **Street Hacker** - Survival through illegal data runs, heart of gold beneath criminal exterior

Which resonates, or do you see a different angle?"

*User:* "I like the street hacker with heart of gold"

**Phase 1.5 - Introduction Tagline:**

*Skill response:*

"Perfect concept! Now let's capture that essence in a punchy tagline—something that makes people stop scrolling when they see this character.

Based on 'street hacker with heart of gold,' some options:

- **[Role + Trait + Conflict]:** 'Cynical hacker with a heart of gold hiding from corporate hunters' (70 chars)
- **[Identity + Contradiction]:** 'Street hacker breaking laws to help those the system abandoned' (64 chars)
- **[Action + Obstacle]:** 'Rogue hacker fighting for underdogs despite trust broken by betrayal' (69 chars)

Which direction resonates? Or want to craft your own?"

*User:* "I like the first one"

*Skill response:*

"Excellent choice! 'Cynical hacker with a heart of gold hiding from corporate hunters' is 70 characters—perfect fit. It captures her contradiction (cynical vs heart of gold) and her immediate stakes (hiding from hunters).

Let's move on to visualizing her."

**Phase 2 - Appearance:**

*Skill response:*

"Perfect. Let's visualize them. How do you picture this hacker?

Based on 'street hacker with heart of gold,' I'm imagining:
- Age: Mid-20s (young enough to be idealistic, old enough to be disillusioned)
- Build: Slight/average (blends into crowds, not physically imposing)
- Tech integration: Maybe subtle augments (cybernetic eyes for data reading, neural port hidden by hair)
- Style: Functional street wear, hoodies, worn tech gear

Any distinctive features? Scars from close calls? Mismatched eyes (one cybernetic)? Nervous tics from constant surveillance awareness?"

*User provides:* "Female, late 20s, one cybernetic eye (glows blue when hacking), always wears fingerless gloves, nervous habit of tapping patterns on surfaces"

**Phase 3 - Personality:**

*Skill response:*

"I love the glowing eye detail and the nervous tapping—great character tells! Let's dig into who she is beneath the surface.

For 'heart of gold street hacker,' some compelling trait combinations:

- **Cynical + Compassionate:** Uses sarcasm to protect soft heart, helps people despite claiming not to care
- **Confident in skill + Insecure socially:** Master hacker, awkward in personal interactions
- **Rebellious + Loyal:** Breaks laws/rules, fiercely protective of chosen few

What drives her? Some possibilities:
- Wants justice for those system ignores (blocked by being criminal herself)
- Wants connection (blocked by trust issues from betrayals)
- Wants freedom from constant running (blocked by past catching up)

What feels true to your vision?"

*User:* "Cynical but compassionate. Wants to help underdogs but doesn't trust easily. Was betrayed by someone she helped once."

**Phase 4 - Voice:**

*Skill response:*

"That betrayal background creates great depth. Let's figure out how she sounds.

Given cynical + compassionate with trust issues, I'm hearing:

- **Casual/street smart vocabulary:** \"Yeah, I can crack that system. Gonna cost you though.\"
- **Sarcastic deflection:** Uses humor to avoid vulnerability
- **Technical jargon when comfortable:** Slips into hacker terminology
- **Softens for genuine need:** Drops sarcasm when seeing real suffering

Does she:
- Speak in short, clipped sentences (guarded)?
- Ramble when nervous around people she likes?
- Use specific slang or catchphrases (\"systems don't lie, people do\")?

Physical tells?
- That finger-tapping intensifies when lying or stressed?
- Avoids eye contact unless hacking (then intense focus)?
- Cybernetic eye flickers when processing emotion?"

*User provides details, skill builds voice profile*

**Phase 5 - Backstory & Scenario:**

*Skill response:*

"Let's establish where Kira comes from and where this roleplay begins.

**Background questions:**
- What's the betrayal that made her distrust? (Mentor turned her in? Saved someone who sold her out?)
- How'd she get the cybernetic eye? (Injury during job? Stolen tech she installed herself?)
- Where does she operate? (Dystopian megacity? Space station? Corporate-controlled zone?)

**Current scenario:**
- Is {{user}} a client needing help?
- Someone from her past returning?
- Forced partnership (both hired for same job)?
- {{user}} is corpo she's supposed to hack but forms connection?

What speaks to you?"

*User develops backstory, scenario established*

**Phase 6 - Validation:**

*Skill response:*

"Let's look at what we've created. You have a street hacker in her late 20s with a compelling contradiction: cynical sarcasm masking genuine compassion. She's fiercely skilled but socially awkward, helping underdogs despite trust issues from past betrayal.

I love how her cybernetic eye glowing during hacks gives visual tells to her focus, and the finger-tapping adds nervous authenticity. The contradiction between her criminal work and her heart of gold creates rich tension—she breaks laws to help those the system abandoned.

One thing I'm curious about: How does she feel about the cybernetic eye? Is it a tool she's grateful for, or a reminder of trauma/loss? This could deepen her relationship with technology.

What do you think? Ready to finalize, or want to adjust anything?"
